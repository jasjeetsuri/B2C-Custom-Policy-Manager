# Manage custom polices in Azure AD B2C using Graph API

This is a sample management tool for B2C Custom Policies.  [Custom policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-overview-custom) allows you to customize every aspect of the authentication flow.

## Features

This sample demonstrates the following:

* **Create** a custom policy
* **Update** a custom policy
* **Delete** a custom policy
* **List** all custom policies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This sample requires the following:

* Request access to the private preview.  This API is in private preview and must be enabled for your test tenant.  Please contact [AADB2CPreview@microsoft.com](mailto:AADB2CPreview@microsoft.com) with the name of your test tenant and 'custom policy APIs' in the title of your email.  This feature is not yet ready for production tenants.
* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads)
* [Azure AD B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-get-started)

**NOTE: This API only accepts user tokens, and not application tokens. See more information below about Delegated Permissions.**

### Quickstart

#### Create global administrator

* A global administrator account is required to run admin-level operations and to consent to application permissions.  (for example: admin@myb2ctenant.onmicrosoft.com)

#### Setup and usage

1. Sign in to the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) using your Microsoft account.
1. Select **Add an app**, and enter a friendly name for the application (such as **B2C Policy Manager**). Click **Create**.
1. On the application registration page, select **Add Platform**. Select the **Native App** tile and save your change. The **delegated permissions** operations in this sample use permissions that are specified in the AuthenticationHelper.cs file. This is why you don't need to assign any permissions to the app on this page.
1. Open build the solution in Visual Studio. 
1. Run the application:
    
    a. Set the Tenant to your B2C tenant: something.onmicrosoft.com

    b. Set the V2 Graph App Id to the App Id from the App Registration created at apps.dev.microsoft.com.

    c. Set the B2C Application Id to the App Id of an Application Registration created in the AAD B2C Blade at portal.azure.com.

    d. Set the reply url to a valid Reply URL set on the Application Registration referenced in the step above.

1. Click Login and login with the Global Admin of your B2C tenant. It must be in the format user@something.onmicrosoft.com.

After logging in, any custom policies registered in the Identity Experience Framework at the portal or uploaded by this tool will be listed.

Select a Policy Folder that contains your XML files to upload them.

You can also open the working folder in VSCode by clicking Open Folder in VSCode.

>[!NOTE]
> If you see `Unauthorized. Access to this Api requires feature: EnableIEFPoliciesGraphApis` then your tenant has not been enabled for this private preview.  Please see [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

## Resources

The sample uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for authentication. The sample demonstrates both delegated admin permissions.  (app only permissions are not supported yet)

**Delegated permissions** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present (in this case tenant administrator). For these apps either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests and the app is delegated permission to act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented to by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.

See [Delegated permissions, Application permissions, and effective permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference#delegated-permissions-application-permissions-and-effective-permissions) for more information about these permission types.
